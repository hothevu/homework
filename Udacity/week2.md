# What I learned from previous week:
	
	
 ( Continue learning about computer science, the examples using language Python )
 
 I learned about chap 2 of Udacity : PROCEDURE
 
 1. What are the inputs?
 2. What are the output?
 3. Work through some example by hand
 4. Simple mechanical solutions
 5. Develop incrementally and test it as I go

 Example:
 	* Find the median number of three number a, b and c
 		+ find_median(2,4,8) => return 4
 	* Get the second link 
 	 ```
 	 ( <a href="www.example.com">Link</a> )
 	 ```  of page
 	 
 	* Define a procedure, set_range, which returns the range of three input values
 		+ set_range(1,1, 4,2, 8.3) => return 8.3 - 1.1 = 7.2
 		
 	* Given 2 dates, calculate how many days between them:
 	
 		+ daysBetweenDates(2012,1,1,2012,2,28) => 58
 		+ daysBetweenDates(2012,1,1,2012,3,1) => 60
 		+ daysBetweenDates(2011,6,30,2012,6,30) => 366
 		+ daysBetweenDates(2011,1,1,2012,8,8) => 585
 		+ daysBetweenDates(1900,1,1,1999,12,31) => 36523
 		
 	* .....
